All eyes on ya.
Ask you how your week been.
Workin' always, let me.
Work you out for the weekend.
Baby, I'm a beast, uh-huh.
Can you tame me?.
I'm gon' let it out.
Let you down.
.
Let's get to it.
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before.
Take you to places you never been before.
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside.
We can share it, J and B without the marriage.
Horse and carriage, señorita.
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza.
Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach.
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'm a bite into your peach.
And um, I think about to massage your feet.
And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep.
And um, I must look amazing with you.
Cause every time you on my arm I got.

All eyes on me.

Put your body on me.
You the one I'm missin'.
All eyes on me.
I don't want your love.
We ain't gotta fake it.
We both tryna fuck.
.
'Member when you used to curved me, leave my text message unread?.
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed.
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'.
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy.
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me.
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy.
I remember when your money was young.
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's.
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners.
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner.
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh.
We in the Chanel store and.
.
All eyes on me.
I need your attention.
Put your body on me.

Lookin' at me like you love me.
We can do it now or later.
She wan' lick on party favorite.
On my wave, tryna surf it up.
Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up.
Certified with the double-M pullin' up.
Tooly got a room, we'll play "Room Up In Here", been here.
Girl, you know my intentions.
I put you on the wall like a picture.
Round after round to decisions.
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'.
All the lights low, but we lit up.
I don't let you down if I get up.
Like you got a man, but you're fed up.
But you know when we get together.
.
You want me to say your name, huh?.
Karrueche!.
