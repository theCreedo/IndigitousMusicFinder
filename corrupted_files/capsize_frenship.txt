Capsize.
Frenship.
.
Up at night I'm awake cause it haunts me.
That I never got to say what I wanted.
Oh my God, oh my God.
I’m not the same as I was with you.
I would jump out my skin just to get you.
Oh my God, oh my God.
.
How could you have ever known.
If I never let it show, now I just wanna know are you?.
.
I'm fine.
Drop tears in the morning.
Give in to the lonely.
Here it comes with no warning.
Capsize, I'm first in the water.
Too close to the bottom.
I'm right back where I started.
Said I'm fine.
.
Your silhouette is burned in my memory.
Rubble left from the moment that you left me.
Oh my God, oh my God.
And three words have never come easy.
Cause you're more than they ever could be.
Oh my God, oh my God.
.
How could you have ever known.
If I never let it show, now I just wanna know are you?.
.
I'm fine.
Drop tears in the morning.
Give in to the lonely.
Here it comes with no warning.
Capsize, I'm first in the water.
Too close to the bottom.
I'm right back where I started.
Said I'm fine.
.
I'm swimming up against the tide.
Oh my god.
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired.
Oh my god.
I'm swimming up against the tide.
Oh my god.
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired.
Oh my god.
.
I'm fine.
Drop tears in the morning.
Give in to the lonely.
Here it comes with no warning.
Capsize, I'm first in the water.
Too close to the bottom.
I'm right back where I started.
Said I'm fine.
.
I think about you, love you, and I'm filled with prid.
