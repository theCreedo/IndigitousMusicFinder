I ain't like them other niggas, you see that I'm different
I creep on the late night, I stay on a mission
Got all types of different bitches
Pussy wet and dripping, I been like sipping
I eat the pussy with precision
6 rings, Jordan, Pippen
I do gymnastics with a brick and flip it
Money to the ceiling, no I ain't tripping
No conversation
These niggas bitches be texting and sending emojis
But no I don't say shit
He try to hang with the homies but tell on the gang
Boy you a straight bitch
And now your girl coming over give me that booty
Know it's amazing
Loving these bitches, got into trouble with bitches
Can't fuck with these bitches

Baby you know who I am and girl I know just who you are
We ain't gotta rush into shit cause being in love is too hard
I'm tired of all these flashing lights, girl we should just fuck in the dark
Once you let me in it, I'm a get to switching, different positions
Have that ass wishing that I was your nigga
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah yeah yeah
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah
Once you let me in it, I'm a get to switching, different positions

I know you got niggas, why you wanna be mines?
On your tippy toes when I hit her from behind
Oh my God, shawty I ain't even lying
What you know 'bout me, 'bout me
Playing with the D girl, have you in the zone
Make a movie how you climaxing in my phone
Got that Nia Long, now you gotta a little Jones for me
Now you after that, ride on this dick 'til you crash in that
Flipping and turning you up in the air like an acrobat
Turn on the camera, this movie we making is action packed
Safe sex is great sex, it's a wrap, Quin
