Vice
Miranda Lambert

Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I'll wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me

Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice

Standing at the sink not looking in the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mmm another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice
