Chill Bill
Rob Stone
Rob $tone two damn phones
Babylons can't crack the code
Used to sip out styrofoam but figured I should stick to dro (weed!)
Backwoods overload don't like to smoke them swishers hoe
If you hit my liquor store it's 50 cents for single Ports

Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said baby just buy dutches cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money babe buy me a Fiji
She said you need a job, bitch fuck a job I still get cheese

Two cell phones, Mr. Mothafuck-a-thot
Mr. I be on that block
Twelve o seven fuck an op
They hear my name they see my squad
Rolling dope up on the spot
I'm with your bitch she on my jock
Ain't got no time to love a thot
Got niggas mad my flow so hot
Got niggas mad my squad won't stop
We in the game won't take no loss
I'm sippin water out the Voss
Got lean all in my fuckin' Sprite
Turnin up on fuckin sight
Mr. Kenny Powers bouta take your girlfriend home tonight, bitch

And I'm smokin' on that widow
When you see it out the window
Got a dusty old tee
Lookin' bummy leave it simple
Growin' up I was always in the middle
So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little
And my brothas beside me so fuck it we mobbin' deep
Always grimey, no findin' me
But I be in LG
If your lil fuck boy lame ass wanna creep
I live by the lemon cause that fucka chose me

Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said baby just buy dutches cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money babe buy me a Fiji
She said you need a job, bitch fuck a job I still get cheese
