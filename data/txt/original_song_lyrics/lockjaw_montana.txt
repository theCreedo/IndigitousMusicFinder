Lockjaw
French Montana

My nigga on the road
You never told me
Montana

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets
And the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'

I chew your lil' one up
I boot a nigga up
Got the snipers in the dually truck and we tooly'd up
I be tryin' change my life
But a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night
I got a monkey on my back
(skrrr, skrrr)
All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool her
I know a nigga blessin,' pray to god
Soon as the flow hit my feed I'm getting high
I go in, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink
Probably think the liquor laced
Nah bitch, I'm 1K
And I'm gonna keep it one-hunda
Biting down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets
And the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'

Slide in the cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket but I used to want to a Hemi
And I'm pouring up the round then I'm sippin on Remy
I ain't fuckin with that white shit I'm throwed off Henny
Pull up to the back, black zac
Chief rockin'
And the feds keep lurkin'
Cause the boys keep talkin'
Rich god
Ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty nigga strapped, we the 49'ers
Bite down
Fun huh?
Got two twig bitches doing 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
50 chains on
Diamonds flashing like Kodak
I remember toting .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K
But I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my lyric pad
Thought I went to Cali
Nah baby I ain't want no Wap, I just want the Fetty

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets
And the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'

Ay, ay ay, ay, ay ay ay, skrr, ay, ay ay ay, ay, ay ay
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Ay, ay ay ay
