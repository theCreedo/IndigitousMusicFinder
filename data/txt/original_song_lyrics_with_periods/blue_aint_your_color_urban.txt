I can see you over there.
Staring at your drink.
Watchin' that ice sink.
All alone tonight.

And chances are.
You're sittin' here in this bar.
‘Cause he ain't gonna treat you right.
Well, it's probably not my place.
But I'm gonna say it anyway.
‘Cause you look like.
You haven't felt the fire.
Had a little fun.
Hadn't had a smile in a little while.
Baby.

Blue looks good on the sky.
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall.
But darling, it don't match your eyes.
I'm tellin' you.
You don't need that guy.
It's so black and white.
He's stealin' your thunder.
Baby, blue ain't your color.

I'm not tryna.
Be another just.
Pick you up.
Kinda guy.
Tryna drink you up.
Tryna take you home.
But I just don't understand.
How another man.
Can take your sun.
And turn it ice cold.

Well, I've had enough to drink.
And it's makin'.
Me think that I just might.
Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn't change ya.
I'd just paint you bright.
Baby.

Blue looks good on the sky.

He's stealin' your thunder.
