Roof is falling let me love me.


Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth (gold up, gold up in my teeth).
Don't care what you say to me, I'mma bite your feelings out (gold up in my teeth).
I missed you in the basement (gold up in my teeth).
But your brother was a good substitute for you.


And if you love me, love me but you never let me go.
When the roof was on fire, you never let me know.
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show.
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know.

Bodies on the pavement (oh, gold up in my teeth).
