i want to scream it out.
from every mountain top.
your goodness knows no bounds.
your goodness never stops.
your mercy follows me.
your kindness fills my life.
your love amazes me.
i sing because you are good.
and i dance because you are good.
and i shout because you are good.
you are good to me to me.
nothing and no one comes.
anywhere close to you.
the earth and oceans deep.
only reflect this truth.
and in my darkest night.
you shine as bright as day.
your love amazes me.
with a cry of praise my heart will proclaim.
you are good you are good.
in the sun or rain my life celebrates.
you are good you are good.
with a cry of praise my heart will proclaim.
you are good you are good.
in the sun or rain my life celebrates.
you are good you are good.
