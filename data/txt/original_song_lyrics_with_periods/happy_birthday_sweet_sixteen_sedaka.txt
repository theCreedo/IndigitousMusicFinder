Happy birthday sweet sixteen.

Tonight's the night I've waited for.
Because you're not a baby anymore.
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen,.
Happy birthday sweet sixteen.

What happened to that funny face.
My little tomboy now wears satins and lace.
I can't believe my eyes you're just a teenage dream.
Happy birthday sweet sixteen.

When you were only six I was your big brother.
Then when a you were ten we didn't like each other.
When you were thirteen You was a funny valentine.
But since you've grown up Your future is sewn up.
From now on you're gonna be mine, so.

If I should smile with sweet surprise.
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes.
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen.
Happy birthday sweet sixteen.
