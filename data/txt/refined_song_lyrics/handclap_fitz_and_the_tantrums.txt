(Turn it up).

Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in this city I know.
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control.
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold.
I want the good life.


Cause you don't even know.
I can make your hands clap.
Said I can make your hands clap.

Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in this city I know.
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control.
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold.
I want your sex and your affection when they're holdin' you close.

Cause you don't even know.
I can make your hands clap.
Said I can make your hands clap.

Every night when the stars come out.
Am I the only living soul around?.
Need to believe you could hold me down.
Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now.

And when we wake we'd be the only sound.
I get on my knees and say a prayer: James Brown.

That I can make your hands clap.
That I can make your hands clap.
(Turn it up).
That I can make your hands clap.

My flesh is searchin' for your worst and best, don't ever deny.
I'm like a stranger, gimme me danger.
All your wrongs and your rights.
Secrets on Broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes.


But you don't even know.
I can make your hands clap.
Said I can make your hands clap.

Every night when the stars come out.
Am I the only living soul around?.
Need to believe you could hold me down.
Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now.

And when we wake we'd be the only sound.
I get on my knees and say a prayer: James Brown.

That I can make your hands clap.
That I can make your hands clap.
That I can make your hands clap.
That I can make your hands clap.
