Hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you.
Crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you.

Ya alright, alright, alright.
You was right I was wrong.
Ya I should've never ever took her home.
Ya I should've just boned.

Ya hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you.
Ya crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you.
Talking about a broken heart running to the restroom.

Looked at my momma just like we rich.
Looked at my bitch now we rich.
Said we ain't got no minor setbacks.
Counting all that money told that nigga just to bet that.

They see I got this money now his bitch like I said that.
I don't pay that hoe no mind I been had that.
When I saw my girl ya you know I had to bag that.
And before me fuck niggas ya they had that.

Try to diss me I take it to your family.
I fuck your sister then make sure that she vanish.
