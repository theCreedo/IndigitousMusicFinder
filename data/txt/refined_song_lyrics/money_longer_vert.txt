It do not matter.
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy.
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder.
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder.

Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder.
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder.
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster.

Money so old that its spoiled.
My lil' bitch so spoiled.
I rub her down in oil.
I got money now you know it.

Your shit look like foil.
Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal.
None of these hoes got no morals.
All my niggas G'ed up.

Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up.
Never though that she would need me that much if I leave her.

It do not matter.

All it is is faction, no time for acting, all this money lasting.
Like go out to eat, get that blackened salmon.
When I'm with my girl we're Pharrell and Vashtie.
Damn it we are not lasting.

Tell that lil bitch that I'm really from Mars, bitch do not start.
Pull up my car automatic, dealt with a star.

It do not matter.
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy.
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder.
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder.
