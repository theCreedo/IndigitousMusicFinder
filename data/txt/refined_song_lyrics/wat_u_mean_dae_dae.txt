Racks in me like a piñata.
Fuck you, blue Balenciagas.
Robin Jeans with the Foamposites.
Hit the club, now my black bottles.

No set trippin', they know I'm crippin', fool.
Jesus piece a 10k gold.
I'm a fuckin' fool, you better act cool.
German Shepherds in my backyard.

I was on the hill, R.I.P Tijuana, rest in peace Clifford Deal.
My daddy backed out, you done fucked up.
Hit the Magic City, pack it out.
You hatin' on me I don't give a fuck.

I'm in Pittsburgh with a lot of hoes.
Young nigga with a bankroll.
Scrape the pot, I was in the hood.
My mama stayed on Glenwood.

Don't fuck around and make me 38.
24 hours I was tryna get it.
I was waitin' on First 48.

Ay, ay, ay, ay.
Ay, ay, ay, ay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

They dependin' on me, they dependin' on me.
If you don't believe in me.
I'm like fuck ya, I'm like fuck ya.
Fuck ya.

Thought you believed in me.
I thought you had them racks, but you got evicted.
Heard you had it on you, you penny pinchin'.
'Til I pulled up to get it, to get it, get it.

(Racks on me, got them racks on me).
I was just broke like a muhhfucka.
(I was down bad I ain't had shit).
Racks on me like "WOWWW!".

Fuck niggas like "HOWWW?".
(Fuck niggas like "how?").
How he do that?.
Jumped off the porch, I was on the go.

Could you take the pain away?.
I gotta make a way a way, way.
For my family, yeah.

Ay, ay, ay, ay.
Ay, ay, ay, ay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Ay, ay, ay, ay.
