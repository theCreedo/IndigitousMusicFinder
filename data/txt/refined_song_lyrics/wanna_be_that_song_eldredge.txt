The radio and a sundress.
Making my world all a mess.
Back corner of a cornfield.
Bottle tops and the truth spills.

You slippin' off your shoes.
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of "Night Moves".

I wanna be that song that gets you high.
Makes you dance, makes you fall.
That melody rewinds years.
Once disappear, makes time stall.

Pull your windows down and keeps you young.
Makes you believe you're right where you belong.
I wanna be that song.
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song.


I wanna stand with you in the third row.
Window booth at a bar.
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart.
When the bleachers are crowded.

When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home.

Let me be that song that gets you high.
Makes you dance, makes you fall.
That melody rewinds years.
Once disappear, makes time stall.

Pull your windows down and keeps you young.
Makes you believe you're right where you belong.
I wanna be that song.
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song.


When you're searching the horizon.
When you're eyes look back.
When you're standing in the moment.
Every life has a soundtrack.

Oh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh, I wanna be.
I wanna be that song that gets you high.
Makes you dance, makes you fall.
That melody rewinds years.

Wanna be those words that fill you up.
Pull your windows down and keeps you young.
Makes you believe you're right where you belong.
I wanna be that song.
