I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar.
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car.
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free.
And that’s how I'll always be.

I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap.
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree.
And that's how I'll always be.

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'.
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'.
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things.
That's how I'll always be.

I got friends that say I live a little like cool hand Luke.
Fast cars and motorcycles raisin' hell in cowboy boots.
But hey on Sunday morning I'll take the back row seat.
That's how I'll always be.

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'.
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'.
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things.
That's how I'll always be.

I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender.
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her.
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down.
Handshake deals fresh cut hay fields and hometowns.

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'.
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'.
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things.
That's how I'll always be.
