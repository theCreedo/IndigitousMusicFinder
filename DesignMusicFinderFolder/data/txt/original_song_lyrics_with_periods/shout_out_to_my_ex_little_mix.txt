Shout Out To My Ex
Little Mix

This is a shout out to my ex
Heard he in love with some other chick
Yeah yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it

Hope she ain't fakin' it like I did, babe
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it

Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate you's" and the tattoos
Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway


Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now, well, I
I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never bring me down

You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now, well, I
I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never, you'll never bring me down

Oh, I deleted all your pics
Then blocked your number from my phone
Yeah yeah, you took all you could get
But you ain't getting this love no more

Even though you broke my heart in two, baby
But I snapped right back, I'm so brand new, baby (I'm so brand new)
Boy, read my lips, I'm over you, over you

Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate you's" and the tattoos
Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
