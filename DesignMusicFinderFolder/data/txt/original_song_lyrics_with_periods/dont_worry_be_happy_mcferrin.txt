Don't Worry Be Happy.
Bobby McFerrin.
Here's a little song I wrote.
You might want to sing it note for note.

In every life we have some trouble.
When you worry you make it double.
Don't worry, be happy.
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.

Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Be happy).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
(Don't worry, be happy).

(Don't worry).
Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Be happy).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.

Ain't got no place to lay your head.
Somebody came and took your bed.
Don't worry, be happy.
The land lord say your rent is late.

Don't worry, be happy.
(Look at me I'm happy).
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Don't worry).

(Be Happy).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
Here I give you my phone number.
When you worry call me, I make you happy.

(Don't worry).
Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Be happy).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.

Ain't got no gal to make you smile.
But don't worry, be happy.
'Cause when you worry your face will frown.
And that will bring everybody down.

Don't worry, be happy now.
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Don't worry).
Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.

Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
Don't worry, be happy.
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Don't worry).

(Be happy).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
Don't worry, be happy.
Now there, is this song I wrote.

Like good little children.
Don't worry, be happy.
Listen to what I say.
In your life expect some trouble.

Don't worry, be happy, be happy now.
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Don't worry).
Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.

Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
Don't worry, be happy.
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Don't worry).

(Be happy).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
Don't worry, be happy.
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.

Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
(Put a smile on your face, don't bring everybody down).

(Don't worry).
Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh.
(It will soon pass, whatever it is).
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh.
