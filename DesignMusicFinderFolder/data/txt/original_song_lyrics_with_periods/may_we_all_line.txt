May We All .
Florida Georgia Line.
May we all get to grow up in our red, white and blue little town.
Get a won't-start-hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up.

Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards.
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does.
'Cause you miss it too much.
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off.

Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac.
Hope you get lost down some road.
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco.
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed-in lotto.

Where you 'bout to go?.
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free fall.
May we all.
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold.

And know that fifteen minutes of famous.
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us.
But we'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes.
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off.

Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac.
Hope you get lost down some road.
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco.
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto.

Where you 'bout to go?.
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't then you just free fall.
May we all.
May we all do a little bit better than the first time.

Get a little stronger from the hurt times.
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one.
Walk away wiser when we crashed one.
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one.

May we all.
May we all.
May we all.
May we all.

May we all.
Walk away wiser when we crashed one.
May we all.
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one.
