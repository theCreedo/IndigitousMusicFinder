Into You.
Ariana Grande.
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe.
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep.

So name a game to play, and I'll roll a dice, hey.
Oh, baby, look what you started.
The temperature's rising in here.
Is this gonna happen?.

(woo, oh, oh, oh).
Before I make a move.
(woo, oh, oh, oh).
So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it.

A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body".
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you.
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret.
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it.

'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah.
This could take some time, hey.
I made too many mistakes.
Better get this right, right, baby.

The temperature's rising in here.
Is this gonna happen?.
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move.
(woo, oh, oh, oh).

(woo, oh, oh, oh).
So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it.
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it.
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body".

Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret.
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it.
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body".
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you.

'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more.
I'm on the edge with no control.
And I need, I need you to know,.
You to know, oh.

A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it.
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body".
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you.
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret.

A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body".
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you.
So come light me up, so come light me up my, baby.
A little dangerous, a little dangerous my, baby.
