i heard an old, old story,
how a savior came from glory,
how he gave his life on calvary
to save a wretch like me;
i heard about his groaning,
of his precious blood's atoning,
then i repented of my sins
and won the victory.
o victory in jesus,
my savior, forever.
he sought me and bought me
with his redeeming blood;
he loved me ere i knew him
and all my love is due him,
he plunged me to victory,
beneath the cleansing flood.
i heard about his healing,
of his cleansing pow'r revealing.
how he made the lame to walk again
and caused the blind to see;
and then i cried, "dear jesus,
come and heal my broken spirit,"
and somehow jesus came and bro't
to me the victory.
o victory in jesus,
my savior, forever.
he sought me and bought me
with his redeeming blood;
he loved me ere i knew him
and all my love is due him,
he plunged me to victory,
beneath the cleansing flood.
i heard about a mansion
he has built for me in glory.
and i heard about the streets of gold
beyond the crystal sea;
about the angels singing,
and the old redemption story,
and some sweet day i'll sing up there
the song of victory.
o victory in jesus,
my savior, forever.
he sought me and bought me
with his redeeming blood;
he loved me ere i knew him
and all my love is due him,
he plunged me to victory,
beneath the cleansing flood.
