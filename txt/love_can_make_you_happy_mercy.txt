Love Can Make You Happy
Mercy
Wake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes 
And the smell of flowers blooming fills the air. 
Your mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone - that you 
Love; 
Your life is filled with joy when she is there. 

Love can make you happy if you fine someone who cares 
To giiiive a life time to you and who has a love to shaaare. 

If you think you've found someone you'll love fooorevermore, 
Then it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay). 
To have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase 
That means the love you've found is going to stay. 

Love can make you happy if you find someone who cares 
To giiiive a life time to you and who has a love to share. 

La-love, la-love 

Love can make you happy. 
Love can make you happy. 
Love can make you happy. 
Love
