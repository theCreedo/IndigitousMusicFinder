Oh my, oh my, oh my.
Oh my, oh my, oh my.
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my.

It ain't my fault you keep turning me on.
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone.
It ain't my fault I'm not leaving alone.
It ain't my fault you keep turning me on.

I can't talk right now, I'm looking and I like what I'm seeing.
Got me feeling kinda shocked right now.
Could've stopped right now, even if I wanted.
Gotta get it, get it, get it, while it's hot right now.
Oh my god, what is this?.
Want you all in my business.
Baby, I insist, please don't blame me for whatever happens next.

No, I can't be responsible.
If I get you in trouble now.
See you're too irresistible.
Yeah that's for sure.

So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see.
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me.
No, I can't be responsible, responsible.
It ain't my fault.

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).

It ain't my fault you came here looking like that.
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap.
Certain bad boy smooth, body hotter than the sun.
I don't mean to be rude but I look so damn good on ya.

Ain't got time right now.
Miss me with that "What's your name? Your sign?" right now.
It's light outside, I just called an Uber and it's right outside.
Oh my god, what is this?.
Want you all in my business.
Baby, I insist, please don't blame me for whatever happens next.

No, I can't be responsible.
If I get you in trouble now.
See you're too irresistible.
Yeah that's for sure.

Then you're the one who's got a hold on me.
No I can't be responsible, responsible.
It ain't my fault.

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).

Baby, one, two, three.
Your body's calling me.
And I know wherever it is.
It's exactly where I wanna be.
But don't blame me.
It ain't my fault.

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).
It ain't my fault (oh my, oh my, oh my).

So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see.

It ain't my fault.

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no).

It ain't my fault you got me so caught.
It ain't my fault you got me so caught.
Oh, well, that's too bad it ain't my fault.
