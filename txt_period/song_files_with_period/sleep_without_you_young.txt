Sleep Without You
Brett Young

Oh babe
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof


Coutin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon

As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls
Girl do what you do

Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe

Comin' home soon

As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin sayin havin a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late

I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no

I bet that DJ'S playin' your song
And your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin'


As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin sayin havin a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late

I can't sleep without you

Ya no matter how late I'll be stayin up I can't sleep without you no
Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you
Never thought I would be like this
