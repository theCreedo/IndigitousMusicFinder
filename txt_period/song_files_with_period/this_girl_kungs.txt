Money rains from the sky above.
But keep the change cause I've got enough.
A little time and some tenderness.
You'll never buy my love.

No world of pain that's as precious to.
No other, there's no other.
And a heart that's real and a heart that's true.
Something that you got to love this girl.

Take my hand.
Or them over.
Take my hand, you.
Or-or them over.
Take my hand, you.
Or them over.
Take my hand.
Or them over.

These treasures don't really come for free.
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me.
Just take my hand and hold me tight.
You'll never buy my love.

You buy me this and you buy me that.
To win over, win me over.
You got me wrong and that's a fact.
Somethin' that you've got to love this.

Will you realize when I'm gone.
That I dance to a different song.
Will you realize when I'm gone.
That I dance to a different song.
It's a shame but I've got to go.

Take my hand.
Or them over.
Take my hand, you.
Or-or them over.
Take my hand, you.
Or them over.
Take my hand.
Or them over.
