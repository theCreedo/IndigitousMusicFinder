Young M.A..
Yo bro, I think I had too much Hennessy man.
This Hennessy getting to me.
I ain't gonna lie, I’m a little smizz.
I'm a little drizz.
But we in the club man, OOOUUU.
.

Yea they hate but they broke though.
And when it's time to pop they a no-show.
Yea I'm pretty but I'm loco.
The loud got me moving slow-mo.
Ayo Tweetie, where the hoes bro?.
Ayo Keys, where the hoes tho?.
That other nigga, he a bozo.
It's M.A, you don't know hoe?.
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny).
Disrespect the Lyfe that's a no-no.
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe).
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code.
Baby gave me head, that's a low blow.
Damn she make me weak when she deepthroat.
I need a rich bitch not a cheap hoe.
They be on that hate shit, I peep though.
My brother told me fuck em', get that money sis.
You just keep on grinding on ya hungry shit.
Ignore the hating, ignore the faking, ignore the funny shit.
Cause if a nigga violate, we got a hunnit clips.
And we go zero to a hundred quick.
We just them niggas you ain't fucking with.
Pockets on a chubby chick.
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit (OOOUUU).
Yerr Eli, why they testing me?.
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me?.
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me?.
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame?.
If that's your chick, then why she texting me?.
Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?.
Every time I'm out, why she stressing me?.
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie.
I don't open doors for a whore.
I just want the neck, nothin' more.
Shawty make it clap, make it applaud.
When you tired of your man, give me a call.
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw.
Next minute calling for the law.
This nine will have them calling for the lord.
They ain't getting shmoney so they bored.
I could never lose, what you thought?.

They say I got the juice, I got the sauce.
These haters on my body shake em' off.
Pussy I'm a bully and a boss.
I'm killing them, sorry for your loss.
