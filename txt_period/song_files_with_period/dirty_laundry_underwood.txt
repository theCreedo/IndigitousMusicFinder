Dirty Laundry.
Carrie Underwood.
.
That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink.
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap.
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread.
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red.
.
Found it over in the corner.
Wadded up on the bedroom floor.
You shoulda hid it in the closet.
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it.
.
Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry.
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line.
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you.
All those midnights sneaking in.
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry".
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry.
.
If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up.
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud.
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch.
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door.
.
Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry.
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line.
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you.
All those midnights sneaking in.
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry".
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry.
