your love is devoted like a ring of solid gold.
like a vow that is tested like a covenant of old.
your love is enduring through the winter rain.
and beyond the horizon with mercy for today.
faithful you have been and faithful you will be.
you pledge yourself to me and it's why i sing.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
you father the orphan.
your kindness makes us whole.
and you shoulder our weakness.
and your strength becomes our own.
now you're making me like you.
clothing me in white.
bringing beauty from ashes.
for you will have your bride.
free of all her guilt and rid of all her shame.
and known by her true name and it's why i sing.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
you will be praised you will be praised.
with angels and saints we sing worthy are you lord.
you will be praised you will be praised.
with angels and saints we sing worthy are you lord.
and it's why i sing.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips.
