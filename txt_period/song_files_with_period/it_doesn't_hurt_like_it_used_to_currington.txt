It Don't Hurt Like It Used To.

I had a couple beers with one of my friends.
?Told him just how our story ends.
?Did all I could to try to make it work.
?But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt.
?.
?I've been out the house, climbin' them walls.
?Checkin' that calendar, exin' days off.
?Hit another bar, call another friend.
?Throw a few down, tell the story again.
?.
?Hey, hey, what can I say?.
?I can just lie and say it's all okay.
?Oh-ho, what can I do?.
?Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you.
?But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
?No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
?.
I'm finally gettin' out back into the world.
?Life is good, I met me a girl.
?She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue.
?I don't hardly ever think about you.
?.
?Hey, hey, what can I say?.
I can just lie and say it's all okay.
Oh-ho, what can I do?.
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you.
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
.
?Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine.
?Sometimes I break down and cry.
?.
?Hey, hey, what can I say?.
I can just lie and say it's all okay.
Oh-ho, what can I do?.
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you.
.
?Hey, hey, what can I say?.
I can just lie and say it's all okay.
Oh-ho, what can I do?.
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you.
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
?No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
.
It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used t.
