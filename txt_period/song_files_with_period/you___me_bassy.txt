You & Me.
Marc E. Bassy.
.
Girl you party all the time.
Don't let me stay on your mind.
Adderall and cheap wine.
Just to stay awake in conversation.
We were always so damn insecure.
So how could we ever know for sure.
Disregard the way I know we feel.
That would make this city way too real.
.
If we bump into each other.
On a crowded street.
It's not us no more.
It's just you and me.
We're just strangers in passing casually.
It's not us no more.
It's just you and me.
.
Shirt on my back with the rips.
Gems in my golden necklace.
You didn't give me none of this.
There's nothing for me to miss.
We were too young on the day we met.
How could we say we would not forget.
And in the shadows there's a place for us.
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love.
Don't let 'em know.
.
If we bump into each other.
On a crowded street.
It's not us no more.
It's just you and me.
We're just strangers in passing casually.
It's not us no more.
It's just you and me.
.
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me.
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be.
Someone give a eulogy.
I know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly.
But you the one to hold us down usually.
We was in a limbo.
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though.
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro.
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window Remember when we first met we might've been too young.
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb.
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one.
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n.
Eazy.

It's not us no more It's just you and me.
