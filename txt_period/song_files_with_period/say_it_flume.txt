Say It.
Flume.
.
Feeling the song, party done.
Shadows walking home.
Walking with our game on.
You are my kind, classic mind.
And you look so fine.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Loving the cold, smoke a roll.
See your fingers shake.
I'm getting through your heart break.
Some kinda freak, sing for me.
Don't know what I need.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
.
Don't doubt me babe.
You make me wanna change.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....
Bite me babe.
You make me love the pain.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....
.
When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Got me falling right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Let me fuck you right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
.
I'm getting the door, silent walk.
Whose the first to speak?.
Speak it like a real freak.
Voice in my head, in my bed.
Filled with you instead.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Taking your time, work my mind.
And I play with you.
I play pretend it's so true.
Follow me down.
Listen 'round to the deep dark sound.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
.
Don't doubt me babe.
You make me wanna change.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....
Bite me babe.
You make me love the pain.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....
.
When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Got me falling right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Let me fuck you right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
.
Don't doubt me babe.
You make me wanna change.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....
Bite me babe.
You make me love the pain.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....
.
When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Got me falling right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Let me fuck you right back.
Oh, oh, oh, o.
