man of sorrows lamb of god.
by his own betrayed.
the sin of man and wrath of god.
has been on jesus laid.
silent as he stood accused.
beaten mocked and scorned.
bowing to the father's will.
he took a crown of thorns.
oh that rugged cross.
my salvation.
where your love poured out over me.
now my soul cries out.
hallelujah.
praise and honour unto thee.
sent of heaven god's own son.
to purchase and redeem.
and reconcile the very ones.
who nailed him to that tree.
now my debt is paid.
it is paid in full.
by the precious blood.
that my jesus spilled.
now the curse of sin.
has no hold on me.
whom the son sets free.
oh is free indeed.
see the stone is rolled away.
behold the empty tomb.
hallelujah god be praised.
he's risen from the grave.
