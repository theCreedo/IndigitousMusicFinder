Hymn For The Weekend.
Coldplay.
Drink from me, drink from me.
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
Symphony.
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
We're on a....
Drink from me, drink from me.
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
Symphony.
(So high, so high).
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
.
Oh, angel sent from up above.
You know you make my world light up.
When I was down, when I was hurt.
You came to lift me up.
Life is a drink, and love's a drug.
Oh, now I think I must be miles up.
When I was a river, dried up.
You came to rain a flood.
.
And said drink from me, drink from me.
When I was so thirsty.
Pour on a symphony.
Now I just can't get enough.
Put your wings on me, wings on me.
When I was so heavy.
Pour on a symphony.
When I'm low, low, low, low.
.
I, oh, I, oh.
Got me feeling drunk and high.
So high, so high.
I, oh, I, oh, I, oh.
Now I'm feeling drunk and high.
So high, so high.
Woo!.
.
Oh, angel sent from up above.
I feel it coursing through my blood.
Life is a drink, your love's about.
To make the stars come out.
.
Put your wings on me, wings on me.
When I was so heavy.
Pour on a symphony.
When I'm low, low, low, low.
.
I, oh I, oh I.
Got me feeling drunk and high.
So high, so high.
Oh I, oh I, oh I.
I'm feeling drunk and high.
So high, so high.
.
I, oh I, oh I.
La la la la la la la.
So high, so high.
I, oh I, oh I.
I'm feeling drunk and high.
So high, so high.
.
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
Then we'll shoot across the....
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
Then we'll shoot across the....
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
Then we'll shoot across the....
Then we'll shoot across the sky.
Then we'll shoot across the...
