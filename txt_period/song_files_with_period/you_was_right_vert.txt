You Was Right.
Lil Uzi Vert.
.
Hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you.
Crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you.
.
Ya alright, alright, alright.
You was right I was wrong.
Ya I should've never ever took her home.
Ya I should've just boned.
Ya fantasy on my phone.
Ya hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you.
Ya crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you.
Talking about a broken heart running to the restroom.
.
Looked at my momma just like we rich.
Looked at my bitch now we rich.
Said we ain't got no minor setbacks.
Counting all that money told that nigga just to bet that.
I know that you ain't got it boy why you ain't just say that.
They see I got this money now his bitch like I said that.
I don't pay that hoe no mind I been had that.
When I saw my girl ya you know I had to bag that.
And before me fuck niggas ya they had that.
Five niggas in including me I had to back back.
Try to diss me I take it to your family.
I fuck your sister then make sure that she vanish.
.
Even though we in the same room.
You just locked the door so I had to text you.
Like bae unlock the door I got to use the restroom.
Like I don't want to war want to caress yo.
