Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars.
It’s easy to give in to your heart.
When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard.
When the song comin' out of the speakers.
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt.
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty.
And you kissed me, and we were....

Up all night and we were feelin' so good.
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should.
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights.
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes.
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire.

Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror.
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier.
Said "Do you think we’ll live forever?" As we killed another beer.
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror.
We were laughin' until we were breathless.
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless.
And comin' alive and we were….

Up all night and we were feelin' so good.
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should.
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights.
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes.
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire.

Up all night and we were feelin' so good.
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should.
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights.
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes.
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire.

World all on fire.
We were setting.
The world all on fire.
We were setting.
The world all on fire.
World all on fire.
